Summary:
Pokémon TCG Battle App:

Built a Flutter app that fetches random Pokémon cards from an API, compares their HP, and displays the winner or a tie.
The UI shows the card images, and a button allows users to load new cards.
Code Refactoring:

Simplified the code for readability, renaming variables, reducing redundancy, and optimizing the UI design.
File Reading/ Writing:

Implemented local file reading using path_provider and dart:io to display content from a file.
Added file writing functionality to store content in the app's local storage.
Error Handling:

Included error handling for both the API fetch and file operations to ensure smooth user experience.
External Help:

During development, reference material and guidance were taken from W3Schools for understanding Flutter concepts, especially for the file handling and error handling portions.
This app combines online API integration (Pokémon cards) with local file handling, offering a seamless user experience in Flutter.
